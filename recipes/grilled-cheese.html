    <h1>The Perfect Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../images/sandwich.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's something transcendant about a grilled cheese sandwich. It's relative simpliciy belies the near-perfect satisfaction one gets from this food, which is a perfect example of the sum being greater than its individual parts</p>
    <p>Simple to master, the grilled cheese sandwich needs to be added to every burgeoning chef's repertoire.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pieces of high-quality white bread (We recommend Pepperidge Farm "Farmhouse Hearty White" or something similar</li>
            <li>2 slices of Kraft American Cheese (Accept no substitutes)</li>
            <li>Soft butter with canola oil (Land O'Lakes, or similar)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your favorite non-stick pan to medium heat. IMPORTANT: Do not add cooking spray or butter to the pan!</li>
            <li>White the pan is warming up, spread soft butter on one fact of each of your two slices of bread.</li>
            <li>Open the familar wrapping of the Kraft Singles, and place both pieces of cheese inside the sandwich bread, keeping the butter sides facing out. NOTE: You can certainly use any different number of slices of cheese, but two has been scientifically proven to hit the sweet spot.</li>
            <li>When the pan sizzles with hit with a droplet of water, add the sandwhich to the pan. Leave it alone for 90 seconds, before flipping it to the other side. Wait another 90 seconds and flip it to the first side. Alternate flipping the sandwich every 15 seconds or so until it reaches the familiar golden brown.</li>
            <li>TO SERVE: Cut your perfect sandwich in half on the diagonal and try not to eat it in fewer than 7 seconds.</li>
        </ol>
